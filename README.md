# MSCS335_Final
This is a group project acting as the final for UW-Stout's MSCS 335 Machine Learning Course. Groups are required to be 2 to 4 students, and thus we have a group of 2. The goal of the project is to do something interesting, well beyond what was done in class, using machine learning. This can include algorithms learned in the class, or something built upon those algorithms. 

# Libraries
